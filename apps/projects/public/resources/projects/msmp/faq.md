## FAQ

Here are some frequently asked questions about the MSMP.

### Can I use it on my server?

Yes you can, but you must include some credits about the game mode and the modpack.
The modpack is protected by the [AGPL](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl-3.0.en.html) license.

### Can I use these plugins or concepts in a video?

Yes you can, but you must follow the same guidelines as for use on a server.

### Can I edit these plugins or concepts?

Yes you can, but you must publish the source code of your modpack under the same license as this modpack.

### Can I play in singleplayer?

You can play it in singleplayer if you are using a local server.
But it's not recommended because the game mode is designed for multiplayer.
