## Installation

How to install the MSMP on your server?

### First steps

First of all, you must have a Spigot server for Minecraft 1.19.4: other versions are not supported.
If you don't know how to install it, you must look at the [official documentation](https://www.spigotmc.org/wiki/spigot-installation/).

Then, you can download these plugins:
- [MSMPCore](https://github.com/msmp-mc/msmp-core/releases)
- [AlteredRespawn](https://github.com/msmp-mc/altered-respawn/releases)
- [BasicMazeWorldGenerator](https://github.com/msmp-mc/basic-maze-world-generator/releases)

You must put these plugins in the `plugins` folder of your server.

Finally, you can start your server.
