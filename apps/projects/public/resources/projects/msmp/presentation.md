## Presentation

The MSMP is a new Minecraft game mode in 1.19.4.
Basically, it's a fusion between a classic SMP and a procedurally generated maze.

The goal is to find the exit of the maze, but you can also explore the world and build your own base if you want.

## Generation

The world is generated using a completely custom generator made by our hand.

At the center of the world (0;0), there is the classic Minecraft generation.
In this area, you will be able to farm some basic resources like iron, diamond, wood, etc.
The PvP is disabled in this area.

But if you go too far from the center, you will find a procedurally generated maze.
To enter the maze, you must find... an entrance.
The entrance changes every day, so you will have to find it every time you want to enter the maze.
In the maze, you can find some chests containing useful resources, but there will be ~~dragons~~ dangerous mobs too.
The PvP is also enabled in the maze.
