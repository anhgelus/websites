## Presentation

BioTechnica Challenge is a Minecraft event like a Terminator (the opposite of the Manhunt).

- Several players (the heroes) with one life against one speedrunner (the hunter) with multiple life
- The goal of the heroes is to kill the Ender Dragon and to build a house with farms and redstone systems
- The goal of the hunter is to kill the heroes

This event was designed to be played with a custom modpack.
This modpack contains vanilla+ mods and a datapack helping the management of the game.
