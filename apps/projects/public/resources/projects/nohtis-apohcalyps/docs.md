## Usage

When you start the modpack for the first time, you may go to the control options and click on "reset" for each keybindings.

Now you can set your own keybindings.

And you can join a server!

### Server usage

This modpack is using [Default Server Properties](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/default-server-properties), so you must just use the `server.properties` generated by the mod.

Check this [documentation](https://modrepo.de/minecraft/voicechat/wiki/server_setup) if the voice chat is not working.

### Create a new world

**This modpack was designed to be played in multiplayer. The single-player experience does not reflect the multiplayer experience!**

When you create a new world, you should go to "world generation settings" and click on the button "Cities" at the top right.

Now click on "disabled" and click until you see "nohtis-apohcalyps".

Everything is set up.

### Wiki 

The full list of mods used by the modpack is available [here](https://github.com/anhgelus/nohtis-apohcalyps-modpack/blob/main/README.md#credits).

Check the wiki of a special mod if you need more information about a specific feature.
