## Installation

It's very simple to play it and to install it. You must use the CurseForge Desktop or the Twitch Desktop to install it. 

You create a new world and you select "Lost Cities (BoP)" for the world generation. You click on customize and select 
"rarecites" in the second page. After that, you create the world. _**(outdated)**_

### On server

The only thing to config for a server is in the server.properties. You must change the `generator-settings` and the 
`level-type`:

```properties
generator-settings={"profile"\:"rarecities"}
level-type: lostcities_bop
```
