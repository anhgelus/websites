## Behind Nohtis Apohcalyps 

Nohtis Apohcalyps was one of my first modpack.

I created it for Forge 1.12.2 on Curseforge.

The years went by and maintaining this modpack became more and more complicated:
some game design errors became more and more important,
lack of updated and modern mods on 1.12.2 prevents me from doing a nice modpack,
it used too many mods so the modpack became very heavy...

Thus, I have decided to remade this modpack for Forge 1.16.5 on Modrinth.

Why 1.16.5, why Forge and why Modrinth?

1.16.5 because the incredible guns mod `Timeless and Classics Guns` was made for this version,
Forge for the same reason and
Modrinth because Curseforge is not open-source, has a very bad UI and make always bad decision.
