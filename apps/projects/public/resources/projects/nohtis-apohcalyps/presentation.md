## Presentation

The goal of this modpack is to recreate DayZ in Minecraft but, what is DayZ ? The gameplay takes place during a zombie apocalypse,
and you move through destroyed cities. It's like The Last Of Us in multiplayer.

In this world, you can use gun, baseball bat and more to kill zombies or other players. You can also create a fortified
base with traps.

If you want to have a better experience, you can make a story around this world or you can make your own goal.
